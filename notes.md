# Publishing data for journalists

### Why bother?

If journalists can't understand your data, you might get one story citing
your executive summary.

If journalists can reproduce and expand upon your data, you'll probably get
more, better coverage.

Journalists might help you by finding mistakes or exploring threads you
hadn't considered.

### Assume people will use your data

### Be precise, even when you don't think it will matter

### Don't use excel for presentations

### Be transparent or don't blackbox your methodology

### Keep it reproducible
